//          code clutter. Variations in execution times are expected to be mostly
//          influenced by device capability, ie: mobile devices are less capable
//          and slower than consoles or desktops.

// to track and smooth these per-update values over a number of updates.

// as the number of models, draw calls, and verticies increases.
