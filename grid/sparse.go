// sparse is a minimally populated skirmish grid. The grid is created by

// dead ends - there must always be at least 2 ways out of any cell.
//
// Basic algorithm : start with empty grid. For each cell in the grid,
// randomly choose one cell and determine if a wall can be placed at one
// of its neighbour cells (Nx, max 4). This is validated by testing each
// of the Nx neighbour cells (max 16) and ensuring no dead end
// (i.e. only 1 floor). Remove that cell from the grid list.
