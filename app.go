// App methods are called by the engine. It is implemented
// by the application and registered once on engine creation as follows:
//	   err := vu.Run(app) // Register app and run engine.
// The application communicates with the engine by calling the Eng
// methods as well as creating and controlling entities.
type App interface {
	Create(eng Eng, s *State) // Called once after successful startup.

	// Update allows applications to change state prior to the next render.
	// Update is called many times a second after the initial call to Create.
	//    i : user input refreshed prior to each call.
	//    s : engine state refreshed prior to each call.

// application App methods. It is also an entity manager using a unique
// entity id to group similar application data together. Each application
// data type is a component with a component manager. The component managers
// processes the data instances for its type. For example:
//     A physics manager for handling forces and collisions.
//     A scene manager for rendering frames.
//     A pov manager for updating scene graph transforms.
// One app instance is created by engine. It is passed back and forth
// between the application update goroutine and the engine device-aware
// main thread.
