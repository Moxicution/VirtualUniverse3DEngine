// FUTURE : lots can be done here, but it needs to be balanced against engine
//          code clutter. Variations in timing are expected to be mostly
//          influenced by device capability, ie: mobile devices are less capable
//          than consoles or desktops.
//      o Rendering times are not currently captured from the machine goroutine.
//      o Loading times are not currently captured from the loader goroutine.

// Timing is used to collect main processing loop numbers while the
// the application loop is active. The numbers are reset each update.

// values over a number of updates.

// Timing gives a rough idea. Expect things to go slower the more
// models, draw calls, and the greater number of verticies.

// Actual number of renders likely matches the monitor refresh rate
// which is 60/sec for most flat screen monitors.
