// Package audio provides access to 3D sound capability.  It interfaces to the sound
// card through a device layer (currently OpenAL).  The audio package is comprised of
// three main interfaces:
//    1. The overall audio system that needs to be initialized on application
//       startup, and shutdown on application close. It also needs sound data
//       that has been loaded from persistent store and bound to the sound card.
//    2. Sound makers that are associated with a sound, location and volume.
//    3. Sound listeners that are associated with a location.
//
// The expected usage is to initialize the audio system and then load some sounds
// into it. Then setup some sound listeners and some sound makers.  Associate the
// sound makers with the loaded sounds.  Then play sounds that are close enough to
// the SoundListeners to be audible.
//
// OSX has OpenAL. To install 64-bit OpenAL on windows use:
//    http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Downloads/oalinst.zip
//
// Package audio is provided as part of the vu (virtual universe) 3D engine.

// listeners within a reasonable distance.

	Play()                       // Make the noise happen now.
}

// SoundListener is the sound receiver.  The listeners location relative to where the
// noise was played determines how much sound comes out of the speakers.
type SoundListener interface {
	SetLocation(x, y, z float32) // The listener location.
	SetVelocity(x, y, z float32) // The listeners movement.
